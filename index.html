		<div class="content">
			Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the way of analyzing
			genetic information. It has eliminated the limitations of previous techniques in terms of
			throughput, speed, scalability and resolution. The effectiveness of NGS technologies is
			further improved by using error correction methodology on the imperfect though redundant
			sequence reads. In this project, we have utilized our HPC expertise gained in the CSE 6230
			class and improved the run-time of GPU based solution (CUDA-EC) to this problem. We
			propose a parallel implementation for the same algorithm which reduces the kernel execution
			time by approximately 14.81% which we have achieved by increasing warp efficiency from
			3.5% to 67.5% and a few other code optimization. We also show that multiple-threads-one-read
			model has enough task parallelism to exploit on GPU compared to classical approach of one-thread
			one-read model.<br/>

	<b class="header3">Fault Tolerance in Software Defined Networks</b>
		<div class="content">
			The Software Defined Networking paradigm introduces the concept of separation of data plane
			(forwarding plane) and control plane as well as centralization of algorithms that make routing
			decisions. Centralization greatly simplifies management of network by simplifying policy
			specification, modification, implementation and verification etc. Although, significant research
			has been conducted on SDN in recent years, there has not been enough discussion on how to deal
			with age-old yet common problem of network failures. Centralization also introduces more points
			of failures such as controller failures in the network. In this paper, we consolidate existing
			work in the domain of fault tolerance in software defined networks. We, then, define the problem
			of link	failures and the constraints we faced while solving it. We propose an algorithm for
			proactively handling link failures. We have implemented our solution using pyretic (a SDN controller).<br/>

		<div class="content" >
			Smart grids are becoming ubiquitous today with proliferation of easy to install power
            generation schemes for Solar and Wind energy. The goal of consuming energy generated locally
            instead of transmitting it over large distances calls for systems that can process millions
            of events being generated from smart plugs and power generation sources in near real time.
            The heart of these systems often is a module that can process dense power consumption event
            streams and predict the consumption patterns at specific occupational units such as a house
            or a building. It is also often useful to identify outliers that are consuming power significantly
            higher than other similar devices in the occupational unit (such as a block or a neighborhood). In
            this paper, we present a system that can process over a million events per second from smart plugs
            and correlate the information to output both accurate predictions as well as identify outliers. Our
            system is built from the ground up in C++ rather than using sophisticated complex event processing
            engines or any other commercial product which is why we believe we have achieved very high throughputs
            with very low CPU capacity for processing the events. Our results show that the throughput of our
            system is over a million events per second while using under 20% of one core.<br/>

	<b class="header3">Erlang Distributed File System</b>
		<div class="content">
			Erlang is recently developed general purpose highly concurrent functional programming
            language. It was designed to support distributed, fault tolerant, scalable, non-stop
            applications. It has been used in production systems (e.g. AXD301 ATM switch) with an uptime
            percentage of 99.9999999% (nine nine's). It is being used by Facebook, Github, Riak, Amazon
            etc. to develop large distributed systems. We have leveraged the distributed capabilities of
            Erlang and have developed yet another DFS namely Erlang Distributed File System (eDFS). It
            is highly concurrent, reliable, scalable and fault tolerant. In this report, we first develop
            small taxonomy of DFSs. We, then describe the architecture of eDFS and compare the design
            with the existing DFSs.<br/>

	<b class="header3">A Long-Term Profit Based Approach For Dynamic Server Consolidation in Virtual Machine Clusters</b>
		<div class="content">
			<em>Dynamic Server Consolidation (DSC)</em> is a technique used by cloud
            owners to consolidate multiple virtual machines (VM) that run client
            application components, onto a minimal number of physical
            machines (PM).  Dynamic change in the VM-to-PM mapping is achieved
            by exploiting the <em>live migration</em> capability of VMs. In this
            paper, we propose an approach which is based on two paradigms:
            first, that inputs to the DSC algorithm should be actual revenues
            and costs, and no artificial cost should be provided. Second,
            that a consolidation decision must take <em>long term benefit</em>
            into account.  We first propose a profit model in which costs of
            actions such as VM migration decisions manifest as SLA penalties and
            increased operating costs. We then use this profit model to
            formulate this problem as a <em>Markov Decision Process
            (MDP)</em>. We do this by narrowing our scope to workloads that are
            <em>cyclic</em> in nature.  Although the proposed approach is not
            practical yet due to prohibitive complexity of the solution,
            preliminary results show that there is good potential in the
            approach and further research in this direction will be worthwhile.<br/>

	<b class="header3">Unified Call Distributor (UCD)</b>
		<div class="content">
			Unified Call Distribution System (UCD) is a distributed system which routes requests
            to specific group of agents based on their skill set in a proportionate manner. It is
            an extension of <a href="https://github.com/OpenACD/OpenACD">OpenACD</a>
            but is independent of the channel associated to any request and therefore, called unified.
            The system maintains sessions of agents, connects clients to the agents for communication,
            shows the current status on monitor etc. The client can communicate to agent on any kind of
            channel such as chat, voice call, email or through any social media network.
			The task of routing is carried by an integral component called Call Distributor (CD). It
			is developed in Erlang. The other component units Channel Servers (CS) and Agent Servers (AS)
			maintains sessions of agents or clients and feed data to CD. It, in turn, maintains real time
			data in mnesia database and performs the task of routing. The real time data includes all the
			agents logged in, queues of requests for each channel etc. Every request is assigned to an agent
			after matching mandatory properties, counting desired properties and at last based on "most idle"
			agent definition. Agents can be configured to handle multiple requests at a time. Such a
			channel configuration is called parallel channel. We keep mnesia tables with hashed names
			where key is properties of agents and value is list of free agents in order to speed up the
			routing process.

Key Projects Undertaken
  Raft Consensus Algorithm for Data Center Network                      [Sep'15 - Dec'15]
  * Analyzed performance of Raft consensus algorithm (in etcd) in presence of heavy load
     and improved it by assigning high priority to etcd messages than congestion traffic
  * Evaluated the idea on 5 node cluster of etcd key-value store, setup on banana pi boards

  Fault Tolerance in Software Defined Networks (SDNs)                   [Oct'14 - Dec'14]
  * Proposed an algorithm for handling link failures in SDNs and implemented it in pyretic
  * Proactively installed flow table rules using OpenFlow to reduce downtime

  Optimizing Short Read Error Correction on GPU                         [Oct'14 â€” Dec'14]
  * Improved efficiency of GPU based state of the art error correction software CUDA-EC
     by 14.81% by increasing warp efficiency from 3.5% to 67.5% and other optimization

  Erlang Distributed File System (Undergraduate Thesis)                 [Jul'13 - Dec'13]
  * Developed a Distributed File System (eDFS) from scratch having master-slave architecture
  * Implemented read and append operation in eDFS similar to Google File System (GFS)

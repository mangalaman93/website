  Guide: Greg Eisenhauer                         [https://github.com/mangalaman93/etcd]
  * Analyzed the performance of Raft consensus algorithm in presence of heavy network
    load and improved it by co-designing the system with the network layer
  * Showed that write performance of etcd degrades in presence of heavy network load
  * Enhanced throughput by setting higher priority to etcd messages than other traffic
  * Exposed the network layer priorities to the application in a transparent manner in
    order to simplify application development by modifying Golang http library
  * Evaluated the idea on a 5 node cluster of etcd key-value store, setup on banana pi
    boards connected in a star topology using a 802.1p enabled L2 switch

  Load-Based Server Selection for Containers (Bell Labs)         [June 2015 - Aug 2015]
  Mentors: Martin Carroll, Ilija Hadzic, Christian Hans Woithe
  * Developed a monitoring infrastructure for Linux containers using collectd, influxdb
    a time series database) and grafana (for visualization of various metrics)
  * Analyzed workload of a specific set of containers streaming arbitrary number of
    pixel streams to remote displays using locally available GPUs
  * Compared load prediction and container packing algorithms using Discrete Event
    Simulation for "streaming" containers assuming a exponentially distributed workload
  * Demonstrated that real workload and generated workload is close enough to use the
    results for real world scenarios

    choosing links for which these paths can be used as back up paths
  * Provided fine-grained control over the network by let the user specify flows and
    end nodes corresponding to which back up paths are to be installed
  * Installed flow rules proactively to reduce downtime due to link failure

  * Restructured the code by having one read processed by one warp and showed that
    multiple-thread-one-read model has enough task parallelism to exploit on GPU
    compared to the classical model of one-thread-one-read model
  * Demonstrated that Bloom Filter access throughput cannot be further improved by
    showing that average bits accessed per query is only 1.25 bits
